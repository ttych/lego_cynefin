# Cynefin Framework

----------

It "explores the relationship between man, experience, and context"
and proposes new approaches to communication, decision-making, policy-making,
and knowledge management in complex social environments.

----------

## 3 Systems and 5 Domains

Based on how we perceive relation between cause en effect.

- Ordered systems
  - cause and effect relation exists, is repeatable and predictable.
  - Obvious and Complicated domains.
- Complex system (unordered)
  - cause and effect relation exists, is unpredictable, with unknowns.
  - Complex domain.
- Chaotic system (unordered)
  - cause and effect relation is underterminate, scope of the problem is undefined.
  - Chaotic domain.

### Obvious domain - "Known Knowns" - Best Practices

Cause and effect relationships exist, are predictable and repeatable.

- Formal communication pattern
- Management style is top-down / command-and-control

----------

----------

### Complicated domain - "Known Unknowns" - Good Practice

Cause and effect relationships exist but are not self-evident and therefore require expertise.

There are multiple ways to proceed, provided you have the right expertise.

- Expert communication pattern

----------

### Complex domain - "Unknowable Unknowns" - Emergent Practice

Cause and effect is only visible in hindsight, the outcomes are emergent and unpredictable.

- Informal communication pattern

----------

----------

### Chaotic domain - "Unknowable Unknowns" - Novel Practice

No cause and effect relationship can be determined.

Conduct 'safe fail' experiments instead of doing 'fail safe' design.

- Crisis communication pattern

----------

## Disorder domain

This is the situation we are in most of the time – not knowing which situation we are in.

If disorder persists we will end up in chaos.

### Reaction to Disorder

The danger here lies in interpreting the situation through our personal preference for action.

Obvious Bias : "The Bureaucrat"
– Any failure is a failure of process.
Complicated Bias : "The Expert"
– Any problem is a failure to give enough time or resources to perform analysis.
Complex Bias : "The Politician/Battlefield Commander"
- When posed with a problem will get lots of people with different backgrounds and expertise in the same room and hope someone comes up with a solution.
Chaotic Bias : "The Tyrant:
– Any problem is a failure to act – take control, everyone has to do what they are told.
