# Cynefin Framework

----------

It "explores the relationship between man, experience, and context"
and proposes new approaches to communication, decision-making
and knowledge management in different environments.

----------

## 3 Systems and 5 Domains

----------

Based on how we perceive relation between cause en effect.

1. *Ordered* systems
  - *Obvious* and *Complicated* domains.
2. *Complex* system (*unordered*)
  - *Complex* domain.
3. *Chaotic* system (*unordered*)
  - *Chaotic* domain.

.. and the disordered domain.

----------

### Obvious domain - "Known Knowns" - Best Practices

Cause and effect relationships exist, are predictable and repeatable.

- Formal communication pattern
- Management style is top-down / command-and-control

----------

----------

### Complicated domain - "Known Unknowns" - Good Practice

Cause and effect relationships exist but are not self-evident and therefore require expertise.

There are multiple ways to proceed, provided you have the right expertise.

- Expert communication pattern

----------

----------

### Complex domain - "Unknowable Unknowns" - Emergent Practice

Cause and effect is only visible in hindsight, the outcomes are emergent and unpredictable.

- Informal communication pattern

----------

----------

### Chaotic domain - "Unknowable Unknowns" - Novel Practice

No cause and effect relationship can be determined.

Conduct 'safe fail' experiments instead of doing 'fail safe' design.

- Crisis communication pattern

----------

----------

## Disorder domain

----------

This is the situation we are in most of the time ...

... not knowing which situation we are in.

If disorder persists we will end up in chaos.

### Reaction to Disorder

Context :
- Difficult to identify when in *disorder* situation.
- A domain is not clearly dominant.

Failure :
- Rely on known and comfortable techniques.
- Interpret situation through personal preferences.

----------

#### Obvious Bias : "The Bureaucrat"

> Any failure is a failure of process.

----------

#### Complicated Bias : "The Expert"

> Any problem is a failure to give enough time or resources to perform analysis.

----------

#### Complex Bias : "The Politician/Battlefield Commander"

> When posed with a problem will get lots of people with different backgrounds and expertise in the same room and hope someone comes up with a solution.

----------

#### Chaotic Bias : "The Tyrant:

> Any problem is a failure to act â€“ take control, everyone has to do what they are told.

5. Nobody done it.
4. Someone already done it.
3. Someone in the company done it.
2. Someone in the team already done it.
1. Everybody can do it.
