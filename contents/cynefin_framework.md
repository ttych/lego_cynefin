# Cynefin Framework

----------

It "explores the relationship between man, experience, and context"
and proposes new approaches to communication, decision-making
and knowledge management in different environments.

----------

## 3 Systems and 5 Domains

----------

Based on how we perceive relation between cause en effect.

1. *Ordered* systems
  - *Obvious* and *Complicated* domains.
2. *Complex* system (*unordered*)
  - *Complex* domain.
3. *Chaotic* system (*unordered*)
  - *Chaotic* domain.

.. and the disordered domain.

----------

## Disorder domain

----------

This is the situation we are in most of the time ...

... not knowing which situation we are in.

If disorder persists we will end up in chaos.

### Reaction to Disorder

Context :
- Difficult to identify when in *disorder* situation.
- A domain is not clearly dominant.

Failure :
- Rely on known and comfortable techniques.
- Interpret situation through personal preferences.

----------

#### Obvious Bias :  "The Bureaucrat"

> Any failure is a failure of process.

----------

#### Complicated Bias :  "The Expert"

> Any problem is a failure to give enough time or resources to perform analysis.

----------

#### Complex Bias :  "The Politician / Battlefield Commander"

> When posed with a problem will get lots of people with different backgrounds and expertise in the same room and hope someone comes up with a solution.

----------

#### Chaotic Bias :  "The Tyrant"

> Any problem is a failure to act â€“ take control, everyone has to do what they are told.
