# Game 3

----------

## Challenge (a)

> Decide in 30 seconds to build either an animal or a vehicule.
> Then build it, with the following constraints :
> - Regular color pattern.
> - Each colour of bricks must only be touched by one person.
> - You are not allowed to talk.
> - Every minute, you (all) need to switch tables, taking your unfinished work with you (but not the material).

## Debrief with your team

----------

## Debrief together

----------

### Complexity

- What felt different compared to the obvious/complicated game ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What makes you feel comfortable ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----------

### Preparation

- Would it have made a difference if you had had five minutes to talk and plan before you started building ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----------

### Communication && Decision

- How was the communication (before / during) ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- How many leaders/followers were in your team ?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- What kind of feedback did you have to guide you towards a solution ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Have you been blocked ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----------

### Outcome

- Compare the result between each team ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Was the result pretictible ? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Compare the time spent with the previous exercise ?  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----------

### So

- Different results produced. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- More planning doesn't make the process better. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The ban of verbal communication keeps from entering long discussions. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- The right process emerges and is continually adapted. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- New ideas and inspiration comes out from probing. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

----------

### Complex domain

- Flow : <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Probe : safe-to-fail experiment, allow emergent possibilities to become more visible <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Sense <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Respond : Amplification or Dampening <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Emergent practices. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
