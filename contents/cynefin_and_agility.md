FIXME: scrum diagram

----------

- *Sprint*, a safe to fail experiment (probe)
- *Product Backlog Refinement*, using expert analysis (analyze)
- *Sprint Planning Meeting*, using expert analysis (analyze)
- *Daily Scrum*, sensing if the plan still makes sense (sense, respond)
- *Sprint Review*, sense if we the desired outcomes (sense, respond)
- *Sprint Retrospective*, sense the system (sense, respond)

## *Framework* vs. *Methodology*

----------

> A methodology is a set of principles, tools and practices which can be used to guide processes to achieve a particular goal.

----------

> A framework is a loose but incomplete structure which leaves room for other practices and tools to be included but provides much of the process required.

----------

*Scrum* is a *Framework*.

*Kanban* is a *Methodology*.
