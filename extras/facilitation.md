# Preparation

- create team (choose a team name)
- prepare 300 / 400 lego blocks per team

# game 1

## Measure
- global execution time
- communication mode
    - how many participants
- decision mode
    - 1 proposition and go

## Expected
- simple exercise with a clear solution
- fast decision mode
    - an obvious solution
    - 1 leader only (the first who purpose it)


# game 2

## Measure
- global execution time
    - preparation time vs. execution time (ratio ?)
- communication mode (expert ?)
    - many proposition (all valid)
- decision mode
    - experts
    - analysis paralysis -> facilitator role

## Expected
- need some planification
- everyone suggest a solution
- a solution is chosen, then adapted during the build process


# Game 3

## Measure
- global execution time
- communication mode
- leader ?

## Expected
- not better with more preparation time
- the right process emerges, is adapted during the build phase
- the sooner they start to build, the sooner they feel comfortable with
- they feel more comfortable if there is a convergence on the appearance of the animal / vehicle


# Game 4

## Measure
- the initial item to build per table
- global execution time
- communication mode
- leader ?
- feeling / attitude (boared, not participating, waiting, building alone ...)

## Expected
- no outcome, bad outcome not respecting the criteria
- feel not comfortable all the time
- solution emerges really slowly
